        HÀ GIANG — The northern mountainous province of Hà Giang is urgently
        reporting several roads that have been severely damaged by landslides
        due to many days of heavy rain. District People’s Committee, Hà Giang
        Province, said the highway from Mèo Vạc District centre to some communes
        including Tát Ngà, Nậm Ban, Earthquakes are a major cause of landslides.
        Landslides occur when masses of rock, earth material, or debris flows
        move down a slope due to gravity. Landslides can occur on any terrain if
        the conditions are right, and cause significant damage and casualties to
        people and property. In this lesson, students learn about
        earthquake-induced landslides and the associated hazards, and how and
        why landslides occur. In addition, students discuss steps they can take
        to reduce landslide hazards. Unlike previous lessons, Lesson 8 begins
        with a Tabletop Exercise. The objective of a Tabletop Exercise is to
        simulate a complex situation with multiple possible responses before the
        students have obtained all of the knowledge of the lesson concepts. The
        historical basis that served as the impetus for the Tabletop Exercise
        was the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami, and the story of ten-year-old
        Tilly Smith. A British tourist traveling with her family in Thailand,
        she recognized the receding shoreline and strange surface bubbles from a
        tsunami lesson conducted just weeks before the event. She immediately
        warned her parents, who warned beachgoers and hotel staff of the
        impending tsunami. She is directly credited with saving hundreds of
        lives as a result of her timely and knowledgeable actions.
